# Analyzing Phishing URL data for detecting potential phishing attacks using various classification algorithms

## Project Overview
This project aims to create and assess machine learning models for accurately distinguishing between Legitimate and Phishing URL. Through the utilization of different classification algorithms, the project endeavors to pinpoint the most efficient model(s) for this classification task. The primary objective is to bolster cybersecurity measures by furnishing a dependable tool for promptly detecting potential Phishing URL and features associated with it, consequently safeguarding websites from malicious activities.

## Data Description
The dataset is in two folds, the PhishingURL dataset and the test dataset. The Phishing dataset consists of 212216 rows and 53 columns. The test dataset consists of 23579 rows and 52 columns. The dataset contains detailed information related to the World Wide Web and URLâ€™s. The data was extracted from UCI Machine Learning Repository Learning
